# Early-Crack-Detection
The "Early Crack Detection of Railway Tracks" project utilizes embedded systems and IoT technologies to enhance railway safety and reliability. By integrating a WeMos D1 R1 ESP8266 microcontroller, LDR and photodiode sensors for early crack detection, and a TOF10120 laser ranging sensor for measuring crack thickness, the system provides continuous real-time monitoring and proactive maintenance. The ESP8266's WiFi capabilities enable wireless data transmission to a cloud-based platform for analysis and visualization. Additionally, we developed a web page that displays whether a crack has been detected and the location of the crack, allowing maintenance teams to remotely access data, receive timely alerts, and schedule interventions, ensuring prompt detection and repair of track flaws to prevent accidents and minimize delays.
